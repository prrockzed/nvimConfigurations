# Neovim Configurations

Here are all of my Neovim configurations, which encompass a variety of settings and plugins.
This is my past neovim configuration. I don't use it now and hence the repo won't be maintained.

I have a different repository under the name of prrockzed/nvim which encompasses for the configuration that I am currenty using. That repository will be updated and maintained.
